# 🐞 Bug Reports & Debugging Notes

Welcome to the **Bug** section — part of the main project **Web3 Project Contribution**.
This folder serves as a dedicated space to record, analyze, and resolve various bugs or technical issues found during my Web3 development and testing journey.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goals of this section are to:

* Document bugs found in different Web3-related projects.
* Track debugging progress and applied solutions.
* Share technical findings to help others avoid similar issues.
* Build transparency and learning from every failure or fix.

## 🧠 Folder Contents

Each subfolder or file inside `bug/` represents a specific project or issue that I’ve encountered, such as:

* `node-sync/` → Node synchronization errors
* `config/` → Configuration or environment-related issues
* `testnet/` → Testnet or chain-specific bugs
* `runtime/` → Runtime and performance debugging

*(The list will expand as new cases are discovered and documented.)*

## 🧩 Documentation Format

Every bug entry typically includes:

* Description of the problem
* Steps to reproduce
* Root cause analysis
* Fix or workaround
* Notes or follow-up improvements

## 🌐 Final Note

Debugging is not just about fixing errors — it’s about understanding how systems think and behave.
Each issue here represents progress toward more stable and reliable Web3 development.
