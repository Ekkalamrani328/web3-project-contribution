# 🧩 Run Node Tester

Welcome to **Run Node Tester** — a section of the main project **Web3 Project Contribution**.
This folder contains various experiments, notes, and mini projects that I’ve created to test, understand, and develop *nodes* across different **Web3** and **blockchain** networks.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The projects within this folder aim to:

* Test node stability and performance across different testnets and mainnets.
* Evaluate rewards, uptime, and configuration settings.
* Learn about consensus mechanisms, APIs, and integrations between networks.
* Contribute to the community with transparent testing results and documentation.

---

## 🧠 Folder Contents

Each subfolder in `Run-node-tester` contains a unique node project or experiment, such as:

* `NEXUS/
* 
* 
*

*(The list will continue to grow as new projects are developed.)*

---

## 🔍 Documentation

Each project under `Run-node-tester` has its own documentation, which includes:

* Node installation steps
* Test execution guide
* Results and insights
* Community contribution notes

---

## 🤝 Contribution

I’m always open to collaboration!
If you’d like to discuss or contribute to any of the node projects here:

* Submit a pull request
* Or reach out on GitHub: [@Ekkalamrani328](https://github.com/Ekkalamrani328)

## 🌐 Final Note

This project is part of my journey to understand **Web3 Infrastructure**.
Every experiment here is not just a technical test — it’s a step toward building **trust, transparency, and decentralization** in the blockchain ecosystem.
